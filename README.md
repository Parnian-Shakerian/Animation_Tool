# Animation Tool

This project is a **VHDL-based animation tool** which allows users to design 8×8 pixel animations with 4 frames using an 8×8 key input grid.

- Create frames for each pixel using an 8×8 key input
- Store frames in registers
- Play animations using control signals
- Digital design uses counters, J-K flip-flops, and a 4-bit SIPO register per pixel
